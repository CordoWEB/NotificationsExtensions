### NotificationsExtensions for Windows 10 - Portable Project

This is the Portable class library version of NotificationsExtensions. It can be used on your server and in your Windows 10 app. It does not include any references to the WinRT API. If you're strictly using NotificationsExtensions in a Windows 10 app, I recommend downloading the WinRT version.

These projects use shared files so that they share the same source code (using #IF for WinRT code).
