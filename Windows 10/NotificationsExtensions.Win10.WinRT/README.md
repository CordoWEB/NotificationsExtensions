### NotificationsExtensions for Windows 10 - WinRT Project

This is the WinRT class library version of NotificationsExtensions. It can only be used in your Windows 10 app, since it has references to the WinRT API. If you want to use NotificationsExtensions on your server, download the Portable version.

These projects use shared files so that they share the same source code (using #IF for WinRT code).
